        1. Inheritance
        2. this & super keywords
        3. Constructor
Inheritance: super and sub classes
        
        class  Sait  extends  khurshed
        //      sub             super
        class  Olexander  extends khurshed
        //      sub                 super
        class  Ibrohim   extends   Olexander
        //      sub                    super
        sub class: gets more richer, inherits all visible and protected features from the super class
                private access modifier is not inheritable
                default access modifier is only inheritable to the classes that are in the smae package
        super class: super class cannot inherit any feature from the sub class
        a class can be extended by multiple  ( can have multiple sub classes)
super: refers to the object instance
    super. : used for calling instance variables and instance methods
             
             MUST be used in the sub class
            cannot be used in static methods or static block 
this: refers to the object instances
    this. : used for calling instance variables  for the class itself
            cannot be used in static methods or static block 
    SUPER AND THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO CALL OBJECT ISNTANCES , NOT THE STATICS
