Topic: Abstraction
            Interface Intro
            Interface vs Abstract class
package: day52_Interface    
two ways to achieve abstractions:
            1. Abstract class
            2. Interface
why do we need interface?
what we can have in interface?
what we cannot have in interface?
Interface: it's blueprint of class, but it's not a class
        public interface InterfaceName{
        }
        we can store abstract methods, and let classes implement abstract methods
        interface is meant to be implemented
    implements keyword: we use the implements keyword to implement abstract methods to the class
why do we need interface?
    A class can implement multiple interfaces
    A class can extend one class only
what we can have in Interface ?
        methods: Abstract methods, static methods, default method
        variables:  public static final ==> automatically
                variables are public, static and final by default 
What we cannot have in Interface?
        Constructor
        Instance methods
        instance variable
        instance block
        static block
interface we have used: 
                    WebDriver
                    WebElemnt
                    List
                    Set
                    Map

                extends vs implmnets
