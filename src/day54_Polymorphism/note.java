            IS A relationship VS Has A Relationship
package name: day54_Polymorphisim
OOP:
    1. Encapsulation: hiding the data, getter & setter
    2. Inheritance: super&sub relationship, sub class gets rich
    3. Abstractiom: hiding the implemntation, abstract class & interface
    4. Polymorphisim: objects to behave in multiple forms
WarmUp:
    Create a class called Animal (Do not use abstraction for now):
                Actions: Talk()
    create sub classes of Animal class:
                1. Tiger:
                        Actions: Hunts()
                2. Octopus:
                        Actions: Swim()
        override super class' instance method Talk()
    create a class called Zoo:
            Create Arrays of Tiger
            Create Arrays of Octopus
Is A rerlation: is inherited relationship between classes
            Ex: class Dog extends Animal 
                class Husky extends Dog
                Dog is An animal 
                Husky is A Dog
                Husky is an Animal
                Animal obj = new Husky();
Has A relation: instance of the class (object) is used in another classes
            class Car{
                Engine obj = new Engine();
            }
            Car Has An engine
            class Zoo{
                    Tiger obj1 = new Tiger();
                    Octopus obj2 = new Octopus();
                    Animal obj3 = new Tiger();
            }
            Zoo Has A Tiger
            Zoo Has An Octopus
            Zoo Has an Animal
            Tiger Is An animal
        classA            obj   =   new classA();
        referencetype                   object
        object MUST be created from Non-Abstract class
                Object MUST be concrete.
Polymorphisim: 
   occures when the super class/interface is reference type, and object created
   from the non-abstract classes that have IS A relashion with the super class/interface
        Ex:
            WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
                driver.get("google.com")  // overridden method will be executed
                        opens the chrome browser
            WebDriver driver1 = new FireFoxDriver();
                    driver1.get("google.com"); 
                        opens the firefox browser  
    2 IMPORTANT RULES:
        1) reference type decides what is accessible and what can be used
        2) reference type can be parent class or interface, and objects can be any sub class
        if we make the abstract class as reference type, the object MUST be created from it's sub class (Non-Abstract)
        if we make the interface as reference type, object MUST be created from the classes (non abstract) that are implementing the interface
Method overriding: ONLY THE INSTANCE METHOD CAN BE OVERRIDEN
            cannot be static, final, private
            MUST take place at sub class
extends & implements:
        class extends class
        interface extends interface
        
        class implements interface
