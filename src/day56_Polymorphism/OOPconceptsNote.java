 OOP Summary:
    OOP: Object Oriented Programming
        1. Encapsulation: data hiding by giving private access modifier to the variable, and provide public getter/setter
            benifits: control the data condition. ( by using setter)
                      Data Security
            if the private data is final, we can ONLY generate getter
        2. Inheritance: sub & super relationship. methods & variables of one class can be inherited to another
                        super --> sub
            benefits: reusable
                       easy to maintain
                       orginized
        3. Abstraction: hiding the implementation. concentrating on the importance/essentials without worrying about the details
                2 ways to achieve abstraction:
                            1. Abstract class
                            2. Interface
                benifits: reusability
                          able to focus on what to do instead of how to do
        4. Polymorphisim: object behavior in many forms.
                        super class/interface can be reference type to any child class' objects
                benifits: flexible
                    - one single variable with reference type of parent class is able to any objects of child class
