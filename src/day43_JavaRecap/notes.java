local Variables: variables that are declared within the method or blocks
            only accessible within the method or block
instance variable: belong to the object. each object has its own copy of instance variables
static keyword: any feature that has static keyword belongs to the class, also can be called through the class.  ( class members )
static members:
            1. static variables
            2. static methods
            3. static initializer block
            4. static inner class (nested class)
static variable: variable that's shared by class and objects, there is only one copy
static methods: methods that we can call it through the class name ( belong to class)
            Ex:     Webdriver driver = WebDriverFactory.getDriver();            
                static methods only accepts class members (static)
                none statics can ONLY be called through the object
import:
        import PackageName.className;  ==> to import a single class
this(): used for calling the constructors
            we can only used it in the constructor
this. : used for calling the instance variables
        this. we can used in any object isnstances
